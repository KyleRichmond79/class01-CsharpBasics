Day 1
This assignment took me about 3 hours.
I struggled with a lot of things. Mainly with the syntax,
but I also struggled with github and VS getting to work together
and getting correct question totals. I was able to figure out the
github and VS problems by asking Amanda but I have not figured out the answer counter yet.
I am still trying to get used to C# so my confidence level 
is very high, but once I get used to it that will change.
I learned I need more practice in C# and VS.
The resources I used were Docs and classmates. And forgot to create a Branch again.

Day 2
This assignment took me about 4 hours.
I struggled with figuring out how, and why, to execute the different exception handlers.
I am not sure if I implemented them properly and I had to create a new question just to get a 
"Finally" in the code somehow. I understand the need for it, just need to work on the how to make
effecient exception handlers. The resources I used were Docs, the textbook, and Brandon for some
things.
